              <li>
                DQR is an app made by Eedi. It is a mobile app that allows
                teachers to quickly scan a class of student's answers to
                multiple choice questions and identify individual
                misconceptions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The DQR mobile app has a companion web app that allows teachers
                to project the current question on to a screen or interactive
                whiteboard.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Before you can start using our Services, you need to set up an
                account in the app ("<strong>Account</strong>"), using the
                process set out below:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    You are only permitted to use the Services as a teacher user
                    if you are a teacher, teacher-assistant, or similar
                    educational professional who is employed by the school that
                    the student you are using the Services in connection with
                    attends. In order to set up a student Account (whether for
                    individual students or for a group of students) you must
                    provide us with your first name, last name and email
                    address. You will also need to provide us with information

                    Account (first name, last name).
                    <br />
                    Once you have set up an Account, each student will be given
                    a number and corresponding ArUco marker that identifies them
                    within their class. You will then be able to access and set
                    assignments, quizzes and other activities for students on
                    the Service, review students' results and use the Service's
                    administration, analytic and feedback tools.

            <ol>
              <li>
                These Terms are between you and Eedi only, and not with Apple
                Inc. ("<strong>Apple</strong>"). Apple is not responsible for
                the Apps or their content.
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide any
                maintenance or support services with respect to the Apps.
              </li>
              <li>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will
                have no warranty obligations with respect to the Apps, and any
                claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses
                attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be
                our sole responsibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any
                claims by you or any third party relating to the Apps or your
                possession and/or use of the Apps, including but not limited to:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>product liability claims;</li>
                  <li>
                    claims that the Apps fail to conform to any applicable legal
                    or regulatory requirement; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    claims arising under consumer protection or similar
                    legislation.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                In the event of any third-party claim that the Apps or your
                possession and use of the Apps infringes a third party's
                intellectual property rights, Eedi (and not Apple) will be
                solely responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement
                and discharge of any such claim.
              </li>
              <li>
                You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a
                country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that
                has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist
                supporting" country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S.

                You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries,
                are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to
                your licence of the Apps, and that Apple will have the right
                (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these
                Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

            <ol>
              <li>
                We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to
                another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or
                obligations under these Terms.

              <li>You may not assign these Terms to any third-party.</li>
              <li>
                This contract, created by you accepting these Terms, is between
                you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any
                of its terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third
                Parties Act) 1999 or otherwise.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If
                any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are
                unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain
                in full force and effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations
                under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against
                you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have
                waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not
                have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default
                by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean
                that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any dispute arises in connection with these Terms, you and we
                will attempt to settle it by mediation in accordance with the
                Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) Model Mediation
                Procedure. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, the
                mediator will be nominated by CEDR.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. This
                means that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection
                with these Terms will be governed by the laws of England and
                Wales. You and we both agree that the courts of England and
                Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction.
